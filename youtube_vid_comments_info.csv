@Tontoquienloleation,"Hyo's choreography for this song was the first video I watched of 1 million studio, back in May 2020, if I remember correctly. I'd say that video changed my life, because not only I became obsessed with this chanel, but I took an interest in dancing and also kpop (I already knew about kpop, but before that I only listened to some songs by Girls Generation). Now kpop is a huge part of my life, and I started studying Korean some months ago. So thank you Lia Kim for being so amazing.",51,1 year ago (edited),06/03/2024
